# Initial Concept\nObsidian CLI Ops is an intelligent command-line tool for managing multi-vault Obsidian knowledge systems, featuring knowledge graph analysis, a terminal UI (TUI), and AI-powered note analysis.

## Vision
Obsidian CLI Ops aims to bridge the gap between the power of Obsidian's knowledge graph and the efficiency of the terminal. It is designed to be a "zero-friction" companion for managing complex personal knowledge bases, specifically optimized for users who value speed, privacy, and ADHD-friendly workflows.

## Target Audience
The primary focus is on **users with ADHD** and power users who need to reduce cognitive load. By providing "one-command" entry points and intelligent defaults, the tool minimizes the friction often associated with switching between multiple vaults or performing complex organizational tasks.

## Hero Features
- **Smart Defaults & Auto-Detection**: Zero-config startup by remembering the last vault and auto-detecting standard storage paths (like iCloud).
- **Scan-as-Needed Architecture**: Instant startup by discovering vaults immediately while deferring heavy content scanning until explicitly requested, keeping the UI 100% responsive.
- **Progressive Disclosure**: A single `obs` command provides a simple interface that reveals complexity only when needed, keeping the workspace clean.
- **Contextual AI Assistant**: Automated semantic analysis for finding similar notes and detecting duplicates, helping to maintain vault health with minimal manual effort.

## AI Principles
- **Privacy-First**: Support for 100% local AI (via Ollama) and private API usage, ensuring that personal data remains secure.
- **Supportive Intelligence**: AI acts as an assistant that provides suggestions and insights, leaving all final organizational decisions to the user.
- **Invisible Power**: Intelligent background processing (like embedding generation) ensures that insights are available instantly when needed.

## Visual Identity & UX
The tool utilizes a **Modern & Visual** aesthetic. Leveraging the Rich and Textual frameworks, it provides beautiful dashboards, interactive ASCII graphs, and clear progress indicators, making the terminal experience both productive and visually engaging.
