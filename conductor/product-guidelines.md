# Product Guidelines: Obsidian CLI Ops

## Communication Tone
The primary tone for all documentation and UI strings is **Friendly & Encouraging**. We aim to be a supportive companion, helping users navigate their knowledge base without feeling overwhelmed. We use clear, accessible language and avoid unnecessary jargon where possible.

## Brand Messaging
- **Empowerment**: We focus on empowering the user to take control of their knowledge. Our messaging should convey that the tool is a powerful enabler for their creativity and organization.
- **Simplicity & Privacy**: While empowerment is the lead, we also reinforce that the tool is simple to use and respects the user's privacy.

## Visual Identity & TUI Design
- **Clarity & Focus**: Our TUI layouts prioritize clarity. We use whitespace, clear headings, and progressive disclosure to prevent information overload. The goal is to help the user focus on one thing at a time.
- **Modern & Visual**: We use the full capabilities of the Textual and Rich frameworks to create a modern, visually engaging experience in the terminal, including charts, graphs, and clear status indicators.

## User Interaction Principles
- **Efficiency**: We prioritize minimizing the number of keystrokes and steps required for common tasks. Every interaction should feel fast and fluid.
- **Forgiveness**: We design for human error. Actions should be reversible, and error messages should be helpful, guiding the user toward a solution rather than just stating a failure.

## Managing Complexity
- **Progressive Summaries**: For long-running or complex tasks, we provide clear progress bars and high-level status updates. We keep the interface clean and only show detailed logs or technical information if the user explicitly requests them. This helps maintain the user's focus on their primary goal.
