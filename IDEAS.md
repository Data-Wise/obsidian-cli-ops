## 🎯 Strategic Refocus (2025-12-20)

### Proposal A: Pure Obsidian Knowledge Manager
**Philosophy:** "Do one thing exceptionally well - manage Obsidian vaults"

**Core Focus:**
- Remove features NOT directly related to Obsidian vault management
- Focus on AI-assisted note operations (refactor, merge, split, tag-suggest)
- Eliminate overlap with existing dev-tools (zsh-configuration, aiterm)
- Simplify codebase: 11,500 → ~4,500 lines (61% reduction)

**What's Removed:**
- ❌ TUI (1,701 lines) - too much code for limited value
- ❌ R-Dev integration (500 lines) - belongs in R package ecosystem
- ❌ Sync features - use Obsidian's native sync
- ❌ Generic graph visualization - focus on actionable insights

**What's Enhanced:**
- ✅ AI-powered refactoring (`obs refactor <vault>`)
- ✅ Intelligent note operations (merge, split, quality)
- ✅ Tag and folder suggestions based on content
- ✅ Vault health monitoring (orphans, broken links, structure)

**See:** PROPOSAL-REFOCUS-2025-12-20.md for complete details

## 🚀 Phase 5: AI-Powered Features (Complete)

### Multi-Provider AI Architecture
**Status:** ✅ Phase 5A Complete (2025-12-16) | ✅ Phase 5B Complete (2025-12-16)

#### Provider Stack (6 providers)

```
TIER 1: Cloud APIs (Fast, Batch, Embeddings)
└── Gemini API ← Default (free tier: 1000 RPD)

TIER 2: CLI Tools (Simple, Use Existing Subscriptions)
├── Gemini CLI (npm: @google/gemini-cli)
├── Claude CLI (Claude Code)
└── Qwen CLI (optional)

TIER 3: Local (Free, Private, Offline)
├── Ollama (easy setup)
└── llama.cpp (lightweight, 90MB)
```

#### Provider Capabilities

| Provider | Embeddings | Analysis | Batch | Cost |
|----------|------------|----------|-------|------|
| gemini-api | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Free tier |
| gemini-cli | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | Free |
| claude-cli | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | Subscription |
| qwen-cli | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | Free |
| ollama | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ | Free (local) |
| llama-cpp | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ | Free (local) |

#### Smart Routing

```python
# Embeddings → API or Local (CLIs don't support)
# Batch ops → API (parallel processing)
# Single analysis → CLI (saves API quota)
# Complex reasoning → Claude CLI or Gemini API
```

#### Config Structure

```json
{
  "default_provider": "gemini-api",
  "fallback_chain": ["gemini-cli", "ollama"],
  "providers": {
    "gemini-api": { "model": "gemini-2.5-flash" },
    "gemini-cli": { "enabled": true },
    "claude-cli": { "enabled": true },
    "ollama": { "url": "http://localhost:11434" }
  }
}
```

### AI Features (Using Multi-Provider)

- **Find Similar Notes**
  ```bash
  obs ai similar <note_id>
  obs ai similar <note_id> --provider claude-cli
  ```

- **Duplicate Detection**
  ```bash
  obs ai duplicates <vault_id>
  ```

- **Topic Analysis**
  ```bash
  obs ai topics <vault_id>
  ```

- **Smart Merge Suggestions**
  ```bash
  obs ai suggest <vault_id>
  ```

- **Provider Management**
  ```bash
  obs ai setup              # Interactive setup
  obs ai status             # Show provider status
  obs ai test               # Test all providers

## 📚 Appendix: Research & Architecture

### CLI/GUI Application Best Practices

**Date:** 2025-12-15
**Status:** ✅ Research completed and implemented
**Implementation:** Three-layer architecture is production ready

This research informed our three-layer architecture design. Key findings:

#### Architecture Pattern: Three-Layer Design ✅ IMPLEMENTED

```
Presentation Layer (CLI/TUI/GUI)
        ↓
Application Layer (Core Logic)
        ↓
Data Layer (Database/Files)
```

**What We Built:**
- **Presentation**: `obs.zsh` (CLI), `tui/` (TUI) - 2,019 lines
- **Application**: `core/` (VaultManager, GraphAnalyzer, Models) - 859 lines
- **Data**: `db_manager.py`, `vault_scanner.py`, `graph_builder.py` - 1,149 lines

**Key Achievement:** CLI and TUI share 100% of business logic with zero duplication.

#### Why This Matters

**Before (2025-12-10):**
```
ZSH CLI → Python CLI → Database
```
- Business logic mixed with presentation
- Hard to add TUI
- Would require duplicating code

**After (2025-12-14):**
```
ZSH CLI ──┐
Python CLI├──> Core Layer → Data Layer
TUI ──────┘
```
- Business logic in Core only
- CLI and TUI both use same VaultManager
- Adding GUI just means new presentation layer

**Future Ready:**
```
ZSH CLI ──┐
Python CLI│
TUI ──────├──> Core Layer → Data Layer
GUI ──────┘  (Just add new presentation layer)
Web API ───┘
```

#### Technology Choices Evaluated

**For GUI (If Needed in Future):**
- **Winner:** PySide6 (Qt for Python)
- **Reason:** Professional look, graph visualization support, LGPL license
- **Status:** Not needed yet (TUI is sufficient)

**For TUI (Current):**
- **Winner:** Textual ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Reason:** Python-native, rich widgets, vim-friendly
- **Status:** Production ready

#### Patterns Used

**✅ Repository Pattern** - Data layer abstracts database
**✅ Domain Models** - Vault, Note, ScanResult, GraphMetrics
**✅ Command Pattern** - VaultManager methods are commands
**✅ Master-Detail UI** - TUI vault browser uses this
**✅ Three-Panel Layout** - Graph visualizer uses this

#### Real-World Examples Studied

1. **Git Ecosystem**
   - Core: libgit2 (library)
   - CLI: git command
   - GUIs: GitKraken, GitHub Desktop
   - **Lesson:** Core library enables multiple frontends

2. **Docker Ecosystem**
   - Backend: Docker daemon (REST API)
   - CLI: docker command
   - GUI: Docker Desktop
   - **Lesson:** API-first design

3. **Jupyter**
   - Backend: Jupyter server
   - Frontends: JupyterLab, notebooks, VS Code
   - **Lesson:** Protocol-based communication

#### Best Practices Applied

**CLI Design:**
- ✅ Composable with Unix tools (`obs list --json | jq`)
- ✅ Machine-readable output (JSON)
- ✅ Progressive disclosure (simple → complex)
- ✅ Standard conventions (verb-noun structure)

**Architecture:**
- ✅ Business logic is interface-agnostic
- ✅ Domain models for data transfer
- ✅ Clear layer separation
- ✅ Unit tests for core layer (70% coverage)

**Graph Visualization:**
- ✅ Force-directed layout (NetworkX + ASCII)
- ✅ Node sizing by PageRank
- ✅ Hub/orphan highlighting
- 📋 Future: Interactive Qt-based visualization

#### Metrics

**Code Distribution:**
- Presentation: 2,019 lines (CLI 318 + TUI 1,701)
- Application: 859 lines (Core business logic)
- Data: 1,149 lines (Database, scanning, parsing)

**Achievement:**
- Completed Phase 1 & 2 in 4 days (estimated 2-3 weeks)
- Zero code duplication between CLI and TUI
- Ready for GUI without core changes

#### Future GUI Considerations

**When to build:**
- User demand (survey needed)
- GUI-specific features identified
- TUI limitations reached

**What to build:**
- Master-detail vault browser
- Interactive graph with zoom/pan
- Visual diff and merge tools
- Settings configuration UI

**How to build:**
1. Install PySide6
2. Create `gui/` directory
3. Import VaultManager from core
4. Build Qt widgets
5. No changes to core layer needed!

#### Quick Reference

**Architecture Checklist:**
- ✅ Separate presentation, application, data
- ✅ Business logic is interface-agnostic
- ✅ Use domain models
- ✅ Repository pattern for data
- ✅ Command pattern for operations
- ✅ Unit test core layer

**CLI Checklist:**
- ✅ Use argparse
- ✅ Support --json
- ✅ Use rich for output
- ✅ Follow verb-noun structure
- ✅ Add --verbose flag
- ✅ Clear error messages
- ✅ Correct exit codes

**GUI Checklist (Future):**

- [ ] Save/restore window state
- [ ] Master-detail pattern
- [ ] Debounce search input
- [ ] Loading indicators
- [ ] Error dialogs
