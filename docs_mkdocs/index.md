# Obsidian CLI Ops

**A Command-Line Interface for Federated Obsidian Vault Management.**

`obs` is a powerful CLI tool designed to manage a multi-vault (Federated) Obsidian setup. It bridges the gap between your Knowledge Base (Obsidian), your Computational Environment (R/Python), and your System Shell (ZSH).

## Key Features

*   **⚡️ Core Sync**: Keep themes, hotkeys, and settings consistent across `Research_Lab`, `Knowledge_Base`, and `Life_Admin`.
*   **📦 Plugin Manager**: Install community plugins directly from GitHub to specific vaults.
*   **🔬 R-Dev Integration**: Seamlessly log plots, fetch theory, and sync drafts between R Projects and your Lab Notebook.
*   **🛡️ Audit**: Ensure your file structure adheres to the "Church, State, and Home" philosophy.
