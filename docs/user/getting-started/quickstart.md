> **Get up and running with Obsidian CLI Ops in 5 minutes**

## What is Obsidian CLI Ops?

`obs` is an intelligent command-line tool that **works exactly like the Obsidian app** - just type `obs` and it opens your last vault!

- 🎯 **Zero-Friction Start** - Just type `obs` (opens last vault or shows picker)
- 🌥️ **iCloud-First** - Auto-detects standard Obsidian iCloud location
- 📊 **Graph Analysis** - PageRank, centrality, hub/orphan detection
- 🖥️ **Interactive TUI** - Full-screen terminal UI with vim navigation
- 🔍 **Smart Discovery** - Auto-find and scan all your vaults
- 🤖 **AI Features** - Note similarity, duplicate detection (100% local, free, private)
- 🔗 **R Integration** - Seamless R Project ↔ Obsidian workflow (`obs r`)

**Current Version**: 2.1.0 (Option D - Obsidian App Clone)

## 🏃 Quick Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install Python packages
pip3 install -r src/python/requirements.txt

# Install Node.js packages (for testing)
npm install
```

### 2. Symlink the Command

```bash
# Create symlink
ln -s "$(pwd)/src/obs.zsh" ~/.config/zsh/functions/obs.zsh

# Add to .zshrc if not already there
echo "autoload -Uz obs" >> ~/.zshrc

# Reload shell
source ~/.zshrc
```

### 3. Initialize Database

```bash
# Create database and schema
python3 src/python/obs_cli.py db init
```

### 4. Start Using (Zero Configuration!)

```bash
# Just type obs - it auto-detects iCloud vaults!
obs

# If no vaults found, use vault picker (press 'd' to discover)
# Default location: ~/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents

# Or discover in specific directory
obs manage open ~/Documents
```

**💡 Pro Tip:** No configuration needed! `obs` automatically detects your iCloud Obsidian vaults.

---

## 🎯 Essential Commands

### The One Command (90% of usage)

```bash
obs                     # Open last vault (or show picker)
```

**That's it!** Works exactly like launching the Obsidian app.

---

### Primary Commands (Obsidian-style)

```bash
obs switch              # Vault switcher (like "Open another vault")
obs manage              # Manage vaults (like "Manage Vaults" menu)
obs open <name>         # Open specific vault
```

### Quick Actions

```bash
obs graph [vault]       # Show graph visualization
obs stats [vault]       # View statistics
obs search <query>      # Search across vaults (coming soon)
```

### Vault Management

```bash
obs manage create       # Create new vault
obs manage open <path>  # Open folder as vault
obs manage info <id>    # Show vault details
```

### Graph Analysis

```bash
# Analyze vault graph
obs analyze <vault_id>

# View statistics
obs stats                  # All vaults
obs stats <vault_id>       # Specific vault
```

### Interactive TUI

```bash
# Launch TUI (now the default!)
obs                           # Opens last vault or shows picker

# Legacy commands (still work)
obs tui                       # Same as obs
obs tui --vault-id <vault_id> # Open specific vault
obs tui --screen vaults       # Open specific screen
```

### AI Features (Optional)

```bash
# Setup AI (100% local, free, private)
obs ai setup --quick

# Find similar notes
obs ai similar <note_id>
```

---

## 🖥️ Using the TUI

The TUI (Terminal User Interface) is now **the default** - just type `obs`!

### Launch TUI
```bash
obs                     # Opens last vault or shows picker (NEW!)
```

**Works like Obsidian app:** Opens your last vault automatically, or shows vault picker if it's your first time.

### Navigation Basics

**New to vim?** Don't worry! The TUI works with:
- ✅ **Arrow keys** - Move up/down
- ✅ **Enter** - Select/open
- ✅ **Esc** - Go back
- ✅ **q** - Quit

**Want to learn vim motions?** See [TUI Vim Tutorial](../guides/tui/vim-tutorial.md)
